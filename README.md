# vwf_screen_turns_off_example

# Problem
When selecting the "Fonts" debug option, my program prints a very long string with toxa's VWF engine. There is a noticable delay and during this time the screen appears to be turned off (see the LCDC byte). I'm not sure how this is happening. I found this while trying to decide how much of the VWF library I could use for my own VWF processes that fire during the VBlank handler.
